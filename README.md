# Coding Challenge Lidabro. Sidebar

Welcome to the coding challenge! In this challenge, you will work with a React application that has a sidebar component with expandable elements. Your goal is to modify the sidebar behavior so that only one sidebar element can be expanded at a time.

## Task Overview

This challenge is focused on a React sidebar component. Currently, the sidebar allows multiple elements to be expanded simultaneously. Your task is to adjust the behavior so that only one element can be expanded at any given time.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Start the development server:
   `npm run`
5. Open your browser and go to:
   http://localhost:3000

## Expected Deliverables

-   Only one sidebar element can be expanded at any given time.
-   When a new element is clicked, the previously expanded element should collapse.

## Additional Information

-   This project is built with React.
-   Feel free to explore the existing codebase and modify any part of it to achieve the desired behavior.
